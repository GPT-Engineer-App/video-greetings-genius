**Description**: **Project Name:** VidCardz

**Purpose:** To develop an online platform that allows users to create personalized video cards for various events like birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries. The service will leverage AI to generate video templates and background music based on textual inputs provided by the user.

**Key Features:**
1. **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive web interface where users can enter event details, choose a theme, and input personal messages.
2. **AI-Powered Template Generation**: Utilize AI to interpret user inputs and automatically suggest video templates that match the theme and tone of the event.
3. **Customizable Templates**: Users can further customize the AI-suggested templates by adjusting colors, text, and images.
4. **AI-Generated Music**: Incorporate an AI system capable of composing background music that harmonizes with the event's theme.
5. **Direct Purchase and Download**: Users can preview their video card, make a one-time payment, and download the high-quality video without needing a subscription.
6. **Non-Subscription Model**: Each video card is available for purchase at a set price, allowing for a single transaction without ongoing commitments.

**Technologies to be Used:**
- **Frontend**: ReactJS for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with an Express server for handling application logic and user data management.
- **AI Video Editing**: Integration of AI technologies like Google Video AI for template generation and Adobe Premiere for advanced video editing capabilities.
- **AI Music Composition**: Tools such as AIVA or Google's Magenta to generate music based on AI algorithms.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data and template information.
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe or PayPal for processing payments securely.

**Business Model:**
- **Pricing Strategy**: Fixed price per video card, ranging from $2 to $5, depending on customization levels.
- **Marketing Approach**: Digital marketing campaigns focusing on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract users planning events.

**Projected Outcomes:**
- **User Engagement**: High engagement due to the ease of creating personalized video cards for special occasions.
- **Revenue Generation**: Steady income from direct purchases, with potential for growth through partnerships and expanded template offerings.
